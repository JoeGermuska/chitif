A Django application to explore Chicago TIF data, based off of data gathered
by the  Chicago Reader (http://www.chicagoreader.com/gyrobase/shadow-budget-tif/Content?oid=1251320&storyPage=3)

Initiated as part of the Great American Hackathon '09 by Open Government Chicago

Setting up:
To get started, you should have the following software installed on your machine.  If you need help
getting this installed, post to the Google Group.

Python 2.6
Postgres 8.3 
PostGIS
pip 0.6.1 
virtualenv 1.3.2
virtualenvwrapper (http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/)
fabfile 0.9 (http://docs.fabfile.org/)

It also assumes that you have set up PostGIS so that your shell account is a superuser.  Again, if you
have questions, consult the group.

Here is the recommended way to start.  If you understand this well enough to
disagree, feel free to do it differently.

% mkvirtualenv chitif
(chitif)% easy_install pip
% pip install -r requirements.txt
% fab init_local

When asked 'are you sure?' enter 'y' or 'yes'  The local database initialization will be run. 
THIS WILL DELETE ANY EXISTING USER OR DATABASE NAMED 'chitif'.  

To verify, you could launch a Django shell and execute some commands:

% cd chitif
% ./manage.py shell
>>> from chitif.geo import models
>>> models.TIF.objects.count()
158
>>> models.TIF.objects.get(ref='T-111').name
u'105th/Vincennes'
